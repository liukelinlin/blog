# Introduction:
In today's fast-paced digital age, video technology is constantly evolving to further enhance our visual experiences. We are always on the lookout for the latest trends and advancements that push the boundaries of what we thought was possible. In this blog, we will delve into some immersive video formats that have gained significant attention in recent years: Free-viewpoint Video, 360-degree Video, Spatial Video, and Volumetric Video.


# 1. Free-viewpoint Video

Free-viewpoint Video is a technology that allows users to view dynamic scenes from any angle, providing an immersive and interactive experience. The Freeview technology uses multiple high-precision cameras synchronized at the millisecond level to capture photos of the scene at numerous angles. The Freeview software processes the images to create a free-viewpoint video that provides audiences with a dramatic and dynamic viewing experience of the scene. The “Bullet-time” effect is one of the popular use cases.

# 2. 360-Degree Video
360-degree videos capture 360-degree panoramic footage using an omnidirectional camera or a collection of cameras, in which separate footages are stitched into one spherical video piece. This format enables viewers to navigate through the video by changing their perspective, feeling as if they are in the midst of the captured scene. But the locations of viewers are fixed, viewers are limited to the angles captured by the cameras, and can’t interact with the environment. 

# 3. Spatial Video 
Spatial Video, aka Apple’s term for stereoscopic 3D video, is the same as the ones you’ve seen many times before at theaters, theme parks, and gaming consoles. It uses the parallax of the left and right eyes to make people feel "stereo". Spatial videos are encoded in MV-HEVC, which involves encoding two slightly different views of the same scene (left and right) into a single video frame.

# 4. Volumetric Video
Volumetric Video technology captures a subject from multiple angles using an array of synchronized cameras. By merging these different perspectives through complex computer vision and machine learning algorithms, a series of 3D models of the subject is generated. This technology allows viewers to explore the captured content from any angle and any position, providing a level of immersion that goes beyond traditional video formats. Volumetric video has immense potential in fields like teleconferencing, entertainment, gaming, education, etc.

# Conclusion:
As media technology continues to evolve, these video formats present exciting opportunities to enhance visual experiences. Free-viewpoint video, 360-degree Video, Spatial Video, and Volumetric Video push the boundaries of traditional video formats, allowing viewers to engage with content in unprecedented ways. With ongoing advancements and increasing accessibility, we can expect these formats to reshape the way we consume and interact with digital content.
